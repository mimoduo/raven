# Raven

> Raven is a *refined and flexible* **static blog generator** fed with Markdown and processed with gulp, pug, and sass built with lightning, simplicity, and awesomeness in mind.

## Features

* **Fast (re)build times** and *completely static output*
* **Semantic HTML boilerplate** written in [Pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug)
* **Theme-able CSS boilerplate** written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide)
* **Live reloading** and device synchronization
* Automatic **syntax highlighting** via [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/)
* Integration boilerplate for Disqus and Google Analytics
* Streamlined [surge.sh](http://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge) deployments

## Getting Started

Once you're set with [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/), whip out your terminal and enter in the following:

```ssh
git clone https://github.com/mimoduo/raven.git
cd raven
sudo npm install gulp-cli -g
npm install
gulp
```

Afterwards, Raven will spin up a live reload server and begin to watch for any changes. At this point, you're either ready to dive right in (especially for those familiar with Pelican) or take a peak into the raven doc.

## Contributions

**Contributions are welcome**! *Ask ahead of time if there's any new feature or modification you'd like to add/make*. You wouldn't wanna spend a whole bunch of time on something that may be rejected.
